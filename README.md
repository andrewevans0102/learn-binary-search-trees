# Learn Binary Search Trees

This is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree in JavaScript.

This goes with my post [Binary Search Trees and Graph Traversal](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2021-01-06-binary-search-trees-and-graph-traversal).

The file `BSTNode.js` is an implementation of a node on a binary search tree.

The file `BSTGraph.js` is an implementation of operations you can do on a tree including adding, removing, finding, and traversing.

The file `DemoGraph.js` is a sample program that uses the binary search tree implementation.
